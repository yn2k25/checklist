FKR Adoption Workflow (All-inclusive, full replace)

Deploy:
1) Create a new GitHub repo (or wipe the existing one).
2) Upload ALL files from this zip to the repo root in one commit.
3) Settings -> Pages -> Deploy from branch -> main -> /(root)
4) Put help images into /images (filenames must match your doc help blocks).

Notes:
- Buttons inside accordions are compact (not full width).
- Main step action buttons are full width on mobile; compact on desktop.
- Checkboxes are interactive but not stored (reset when you leave the step or refresh).
